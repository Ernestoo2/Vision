## ⚙️ Development Rules

To keep our workflow clean and collaborative, follow these development rules:

### 🔀 Branching Strategy

| Branch         | Purpose                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `main`         | Stable production-ready code |
| `develop`      | Latest merged features (active dev) |
| `feature/*`    | For new features (e.g., `feature/navbar`) |
| `bugfix/*`     | For fixing bugs             |
| `hotfix/*`     | For urgent production fixes |

> ✅ Always branch off from `develop`.

### ✅ Git & PR Guidelines

- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow this format:
  - `Feature: add navbar component`
  - `Fix: correct layout spacing in footer`
- Always make a pull request into `develop`
- Never commit directly to `main`
- All PRs must be:
  - Reviewed by at least 1 team member
  - Passing all checks (e.g. lint, build)

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

Before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
```

Make sure your code:
- Is modular, reusable, and well-commented
- Matches the project's design system
- Doesn’t break existing functionality
